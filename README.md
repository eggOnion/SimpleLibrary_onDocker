# Simple Library App 


**<br/>Integrate from my previous [Java Springboot app](https://github.com/eggOnion/library_BookLoaningSystem/blob/main/README.md)** 
_<br/>Now running on Docker ðŸ™Œ_


## What this app does?

An library book loaning system app to showcase Java on Springboot with Postgres to demostrate the RDBMS (Relational Database Management System). 

***

## What is Docker?

It is a software platform that allows you to build, test & deploy your application easily. When Docker runs, it packed your app into units called containers. It then pull informations from your `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` file to include the libraries, system tools & database so that your application can run on Docker.

The best of all is that **NO INSTALLATION** and **NO SETUPS** of other software is needed. All you need is to install `Docker Desktop` and sign-in.

**Here's the link [download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)**

***

## How to run

Ensure that you already have a Docker Desktop installed on your system.

1. Clone this project.
2. Run `docker compose up` on you WSL terminal.
```
docker compose up
```
3. It takes around 5-8mins to build the app. Depending on your speed.
4. That's all. It's done!
<br/>

<br/>If any codes/contents were modified, then use the --build flag:
```
docker compose up --build
```

## How to use the app

### Ensure that `docker compose up` runs successfully.


**<br/>1. Access the endpoint using `thunder-client` or `Postman`.**
